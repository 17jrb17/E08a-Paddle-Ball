# E08a-Paddle-Ball

I greated objects and collision spaces snapped to those objects (i.e. ball and paddle) so that the objects don't just go through eachother. I also created a wall with collision so that the ball object bounces off there. Then I changed the script of the paddle so that it follows the mouse. So now it's just breakout without the uh breaking.
